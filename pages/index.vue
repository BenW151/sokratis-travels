              <p>
                I transitioned from Network Engineering and IT Service Desk to
                Web Development to merge my technical skills with my passion for
                design. Self-taught and proficient in modern web technologies
                like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I focus on creating
                user-friendly and visually appealing websites. I believe in
                designs where form and function work together seamlessly,
                ensuring that each project is not only aesthetically pleasing
                but also highly functional. My aim is to continuously innovate
                and exceed expectations in every project.

                I bring a solid foundation in web development and design,
                focused on creating functional and visually appealing digital
                experiences. I craft responsive, SEO-friendly websites using
                HTML5 and CSS3, and enhance user interaction with dynamic
                JavaScript functionalities. With a focus on Vue and Nuxt, I
                develop efficient UI components and manage application state
                using modern techniques. My proficiency in Figma allows me to
                create clean, functional design prototypes that align with
                project goals. Additionally, my design skills ensure layouts and
                graphics are both visually compelling and practical. Each
                project demonstrates my ability to merge technical capabilities
                with creative insights, ensuring innovation and quality.

                After a successful career as a Network Engineer and IT Service
                Desk professional, I made a proactive career switch to web
                development. Driven by a passion for creating dynamic and
                user-friendly websites, I undertook extensive self-study to
                learn modern web technologies. Through dedicated learning and
                hands-on projects, I have developed strong skills in HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript, and various web development frameworks. I am excited
                to bring my technical expertise and problem-solving abilities
                into a web development role.
