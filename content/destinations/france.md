gettingAround: Getting around France is easy and efficient, thanks to its excellent public transportation network. The high-speed TGV trains connect major cities in just a few hours, making day trips from Paris to Lyon or Marseille possible. In the cities, metros, trams, and buses are reliable and affordable.
